# Blog (v3)

This is the newest version of my blog, powered by Astro Micro and running on Vercel*

This blog runs a (very slightly) modified version of Astro Micro with small changes and general config stuff

## Why?

I like writing, and I want to try this to talk about my interests, what I have learned and document my life experiences.

Even if this blog doesn't go very far, if I manage to help, inform, or entertain even just one person with it, I consider that a job well done.

## Tech Stack

- GitHub Desktop & VSCode - Development and Writing
- Cloudflare - Domains and DNS management
- Vercel* - Hosting and PR deployment management

*Looking to change this to Cloudflare Pages in the future

StackBlitz was previously used for some minor development work, however it doesn't actually work with this repository as it doesn't support *native* VS Code extensions

## Local Installation

Requires NodeJS version `20.3.0` or later, because Astro

Clone the repository (I use GitHub Desktop for this but Git CLI also works well), then:
```
npm i
```
```
npm run build
```
```
npm run dev
```
A local server should now be running with the blog!
