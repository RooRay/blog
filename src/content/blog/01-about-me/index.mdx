## Education and Career Prospects

As of 6th August 2024, I have just finished my National 5 exams and am now studying for Higher exams. Higher exams in Scotland are the type that are required to apply for university or similar roles like an [Apprenticeship](https://www.apprenticeships.gov.uk/influencers/what-is-an-apprenticeship).

I'm eager to do an Apprenticeship at a <abbr title="Financial Technology company, such as a bank">Fintech</abbr> with an office near me, such as JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley or Barclays. These applications are handled separately from <abbr title="UCAS is the system for applying for university in the UK">UCAS</abbr> so there are no restrictions on how many I can apply for.

Alternatively, I would like to go to university to study Computer Science although I don't particularly have a university preference yet. What I do know is that most of the universities I am considering desire multiple A grades, usually in at least Maths and Computer Science at a Higher level. I would like to go to a university close enough that I can commute to it rather than having to live away from home to save money. As of writing, [university is free for Scottish students attending Scottish universities](https://www.saas.gov.uk/full-time/undergraduates) and is paid for by <abbr title="Student Awards Agency Scotland, they pay for our university and help issue stuent loans in Scotland">SAAS</abbr>.

## Interests

Currently my primary interests are in building and maintaining computers and computer systems. I have a <abbr title="Virtual Private Server">VPS</abbr> that I host a Discord music bot on and I also run a modded Minecraft server for my friends, currently it's running [SkyFactory 4](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/skyfactory-4).

I'm also interested in Retro Gaming. Currently I am playing games like Wii Sports Resort and [CTGP-R](https://chadsoft.co.uk/) (modded Mario Kart Wii) on my Wii complete with tools to do things like enabling community-ran online connectivity. In addition to this I'm also making lots of hardware changes to my Gameboy Advance which was generously given to me by a friend. I am replacing the screen with a modern IPS one and the outer casing and buttons with brand new ones to help further my knowledge of computer hardware and how these devices work.

I also really like building physical servers and running a small homelab. Currently it is just built out of Raspberry Pis but also at one point contained a decomissioned Office PC that was later gifted to a friend. The Raspberry Pi 3Bs both run a variety of software, one runs <abbr title="Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast, a system used to track the position of aircraft">ADS-B</abbr> software to track the positions of all sorts of aircraft and feed that to FlightAware and Flightradar24. Another runs Portainer on Ubuntu 22.04, this server runs awesome projects like [Mealie](https://mealie.io/), [Homarr](https://homarr.dev/) and [NGINX Proxy Manager](https://nginxproxymanager.com) for local SSL certificate management.

I'm also quite interested in Business. Both studying it at school but also exploring how different companies are ran, how they make their money, how they brand themselves, etc.
