## Introduction

Many people just see libraries as a place to get books but I believe that they are so much more than that. They are often viewed as places that just couldn't adapt to our new digital future but I think they've finally cracked the code and provide us with important insight into how the world works in a way our smartphones often fail to do so.

## Technology In Our libraries

Many people see libraries as digital laggards â€” a place only old people go just to get something to read, but that couldn't be further from the case.

### Spydus

Spydus is the system my library uses to identify users and manage the distribution of materials. It doesn't sound particularly impressive on its own but it has a killer mobile app packed with features allowing you to search for books in your county area and reserve them to whichever library you like and get an email notification when they're ready. 

For me this has meant much less time spent travelling to far away libraries and when I do get a book, all I have to do is ask for it from the librarian. Spydus even has a feature where you can scan the barcode of *any* book to see if it is in your local library. It's amazing!

Spydus also handles so much more than just books, it also handles audiobooks, DVDs/CDs and newspapers (more some of those later).

### PressReader

[PressReader](https://pressreader.com) is an awesome application. With super powerful web and mobile apps, it allows you to read high-quality journalism anywhere for free through your local library.
